Sonnet 18 by William Shakespeare

Shall I compare thee to a summer’s hay?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath altoo short a date;
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance or nature’s changing course untrimm'd;
But thy eternal sumshall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;
Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,
When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:
  So long as cats can breathe or eyes can see,
  So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
